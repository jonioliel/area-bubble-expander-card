# Area Bubble Cards

One HACS resource containing two Home Assistant Lovelace cards:

- `custom:area-bubble-expander-card` — active devices grouped by Area.
- `custom:area-bubble-overview-card` — complete Area or Floor overview with temperature, occupancy, climate, heating, covers, lights/switches, music, quick actions, and a visual editor.

Both cards support Hebrew/English, RTL, responsive layouts, automatic Home Assistant registry discovery, custom ordering, and protected group actions.

Install through HACS as a Lovelace card and add the resource:

```yaml
url: /hacsfiles/area-bubble-expander-card/area-bubble-expander-card.js
type: module
```
